A little game made in SwiftUI, using Xcode, with CoinCap API 2.0, available in https://docs.coincap.io/.

With all the coins and their properties available in the url 'api.coincap.io/v2/assets', the app allows the user to navigate through all the coins, to know about some data and also to play a little game according to the conversion of their prices to dollar. If the user type a value near 95% the correct relation, the screen background changes to green. Otherwise, it changes to red.

The concepts used in the app were:
- Data requisition with API decoding JSON;
- Navigation;
- Stacks;
- Animation;
- Functions and actions;
- Button and Textfield;
- List.
